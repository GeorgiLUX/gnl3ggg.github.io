          <p>Building websites is a valuable UX skill.<br>Work should be completed efficiently, not effectively.<br>


          <p>My website building methodology is based on getting websites up and running in the most time efficient way prioritizing functionality, discoverability and usability  while having a modern and aesthetic feel to them.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>My HMTL, CSS and JS abilities cover these steps to website building:</p>
          <br>
          <ol>

          <li>Receiving the clear idea and goal of the soon-to-be build website</li>
          
          <p class="list">
          By means of clear communication and empathy, a web-builder, like a  UX-er, should be capable of clearly understanding the root of the problem i.e. the need for a website, it's real motivation for existing and end goal.</p>

          <li>Early conceptual design creation through a specialised existing template. </li>

          <p class="list"> These specialised templates can be downloaded and used with different HTML/CSS frameworks such as - Bootstrap, Foundation, Semantic UI, Purse CSS, etc. 

          <br>These framewokrs not only help to not reinvent the wheel when building a website, they provide an intuitive grip on the process and a good level of control over the responsive design.</p>

          <li>Gathering the needed material for the website (specialised trademark media content - pictures, videos, logos, icons, etc.). </li>

          <p class="list">When constructing a website, materials and knowledge are needed, but without a goal and a story, the indentity of it are non-existent.

          <li>Constructing HMTL/CSS backbones to pages.</li>

          <p class="list">In order to have a fully responsive and user friendly design, no matter the way it is build (grid system, float system, box model, etc.) the backbone of the website is of paramount importance, since proper functioning of the aesthetic look ( CSS styling) is heavily dependant of the existance of a proper foundation.</p>

          <li>Inserting content and modern style implementation.</li>

          <p class="list"> CSS was created in the mid 90's as a means to describing the presentation of a document, using sets of rules on selectors through a declaration block, by the  World Wide Web Consortium. But it's  also a way to display the designer's sense of style and aesthetics, a very important trait which gives the website it's feel to the users.</p>

          <li>Device and browser optimization.</li>

          <p class="list">A website should be made in such a way that it accomodates itself to the users, no matter the device or browser they are using. </p>

          <li>Extra feature implementation, based on user actions, rooted in their motivations.</li>

          <p class="list"> This step adds a whole array of varied features to websites which I learned at the end of my course. 
          <be>Their function is to better the user experience, the client's needs or both. They include features like - "Back to top" button, varied modals, share buttons, email subscriptions, social meta tags, different forms, smooth scrolling, etc.</p>

          <p class="zaplata"> 
          The point of this project was to build onto an already working website in the jobs and employment sphere and optimize it in every aspect.
          <br><br>
          This required various research methods and a disciplined UX mindset to produce efficient results.
          <br><br>
          A whole array of problems were discovered, but all of them amendable.
          The whole research and analysis was accumulated into a UX presentational report, where I thoroughly describe the principles of the research and analysis as well as sumbitting my humble recommendations.
