          <h3>How I build websites:</h3>

          <p>I thing it's important for me to show what my methodology for building websites is, since it is a valuable UX skill.<br>Work should be completed efficiently, not effectively.<br>The course I completed for HTML/CSS, courtesy of Ryan Bonhard at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-to-build-beautiful-html5-and-css3-websites-in-1-month/learn/v4/overview">Udemy.com</a>, was pretty effective in teaching the student to linearly build modern looking websites, but the point of learning is for thorough understanding not copying a bunch of code and working on a system without fully understanding the how, what and why. 

          <br>
          <br>
          Therefore, I searched for additional knowledge to understand how the most important elements in HTML and CSS work and effect one another, along with some JavaScript and compiled tens of pages worth of notes serving primarily two functions:
          <br></p>
          <ul>
          <li>To quickly recover my knowledge of website building if, in some point in the future, I forget all or most of it.</li>
          <br>
          <li>To build websites as quick as systematically possible, thanks to the steps I made to the whole process of website building, the notes being created in a way to compliment the effectiveness of these steps.</li></ul>
          <br>
          <p>
          My website building steps take into consideration not only my own personal projects, concerned with website building, but the possibility of client existance and meeting their's and their end user's needs and goals:
          </p>
          <br>
          <ol>

          <li>Receiving the clear idea and goal of the soon-to-be build website</li>
          
          <p class="list">
          By means of clear communication and empathy, a web-builder, like a  UX-er, should be capable of clearly understanding the root of the problem i.e. the need for a website, it's real motivation for existing and end goal.</p>

          <li>Creating an early conceptual design by using an existing template, specialised for the main function of the website. </li>

          <p class="list"> These specialised templates can be downloaded and used with different HTML/CSS frameworks such as - Bootstrap, Foundation, Semantic UI, Purse CSS, etc. 

          <br>These framewokrs not only help to not reinvent the wheel when building a website, they provide an intuitive grip on the process and a good level of control over the responsive design.</p>

          <li>Gathering the needed material for the website (specialised trademark media content - pictures, videos, logos, icons, etc.). </li>

          <p class="list">When constructing a website, materials and knowledge are needed, but without a goal and a story, the indentity of it are non-existent.

          <li>Constructing the HMTL/CSS backbone of the pages.</li>

          <p class="list">In order to have a fully responsive and user friendly design, no matter the way it is build (grid system, float system, box model, etc.) the backbone of the website is of paramount importance, since proper functioning of the aesthetic look ( CSS styling) is heavily dependant of the existance of a proper foundation.</p>

          <li>Inserting the content and implementing the styling.</li>

          <p class="list"> CSS was created in the mid 90's as a means to describing the presentation of a document, using sets of rules on selectors through a declaration block, by the  World Wide Web Consortium. But it's  also a way to display the designer's sense of style and aesthetics, a very important trait which gives the website it's feel to the users.</p>

          <li>Device and browser optimization.</li>

          <p class="list">A website should be made in such a way that it accomodates itself to the users, no matter the device or browser they are using. </p>

          <li>Features needed based on user actions, rooted in their motivations.</li>

          <p class="list"> This step adds a whole array of varied features to websites which I learned at the end of my course. 
          <be>Their function is to better the user experience, the client's needs or both. They include features like - "Back to top" button, varied modals, share buttons, email subscriptions, social meta tags, different forms, smooth scrolling, etc.</p>

          <h3>User experience projects:</h3>


          <h2>Optimization of a website</h2>

          <p> 
          This first project was a part of the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-to-build-beautiful-html5-and-css3-websites-in-1-month/learn/v4/overview" target=_blank> Udemy.com</a>  advanced UX course, led by  university professor Brendan Bolton-Klinger, based on real life examples of how a UX project is conducted with all the variables and invariables, as well as many diverse tasks for the students. <br><br> One of these tasks I made into a full scale research and analysis project of a website of my choosing and through heuristic,competitive and comparative analysis as well as other UX techniques, I managed to compile a list of problems for the website and respectfully submitted my thoughts on their solutions.<br><br>
